- **Frontend Layer**: React Native mobile applications with Material Design UI
- **Backend Services**: Node.js/Express.js REST API with microservices architecture
- **Data Layer**: AWS Aurora MySQL, Redis, S3, CloudFront CDN
- **Integration Layer**: External marketplace APIs (eBay, Amazon, Walmart)
- **Security Layer**: AWS IAM, JWT authentication, SSL/TLS encryption

### Key Features

- Multi-platform marketplace integration
- AI-powered listing creation and management
- BuyShield secure transaction protection
- Automated shipping management
- Real-time analytics and reporting
