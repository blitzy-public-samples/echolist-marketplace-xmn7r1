EchoList (v4)
Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the requirements for developing EchoList, a multi-platform marketplace designed to streamline buying and selling for everyday users. This PRD integrates all previous requirements and incorporates additional features such as return and dispute handling, social media sharing, BuyShield services for local pickup, and detailed backend development specifications.
1.1.1 Expectation
We are expecting this PRD to generate backend code which will create lots of API endpoints. These endpoints create individual functionality, all the APIs combined create the entire echolist infrastructure. If some of the backend API endpoints are supposed to generate data, it should be in JSON format. The API endpoints will be called from the front end, and collect the JSON data from the backend to display in the frontend. We understand that the front end will not look and feel like our UI mockup, however we feel it will be a great base for our front end developer to start working with. It will also serve as a guide to using the right front end technology to write once and deploy to both iOS and android. 
We do provide a techstack that we think should work well for this project, but we are open to a different techstack.  However do realize we have a $10k-$100k credit with AWS that we would like to utilize to save on infrastructure costs.

? EchoList sets guidelines and parameters for return policies, but ultimately, it is up to the seller to pick a return policy they are comfortable with.
? Return Policy Options:
? No Returns. (or Sold As-Is.)
? 7-Day Return Window.
? 14-Day Return Window.
? 30-Day Return Window.
3.12.2 Return Process Flow
? Initiation:
? Buyers can initiate a return request through the platform (EchoList or external marketplaces).
? If a return is initiated and the buyer requests a return that falls within the seller's return policy, EchoList notifies the seller that the buyer has initiated a return.
? Notification:
? EchoList notifies the seller that the buyer has initiated a return process that fell within the scope of the seller's return policy.
? Process Overview:
? AI Categorization: The system's AI analyzes the request and categorizes it (e.g., damaged item, buyer's remorse, wrong item, missing parts, etc).
? Seller Response: Sellers receive notifications with details of the return request and can approve or dispute the return.  If the seller fails to respond within 48 hours, the return will be approved.
? Completion: Upon return receipt and inspection, if the seller approves within 48 hours the refund is processed, and inventory is updated. If the seller declines the return then the seller will need to dispute the transaction.
? Adherence to Platform Policies:
? Whenever an item sells on EchoList, adhere to the return policy of the platform it sells on.
? If the platform does not have return guardrails, refer to the seller's listing and specifics.
? In case of disputes, refer to the platform first, under the EchoList account.
? Lost Items:
? If there is a lost item during transit, EchoList refers to the stripe insurance recovery and refunds the buyer and emails the buyer an explanation of what happened. The seller will get reimbursed if stripe insurance recovery occurs. These types of transactions get emailed to support@EchoList.co
3.12.3 External Platform Return Policies

We will implement  our own insurance company in case we are on the hook for an item that does not come out favorable in a dispute on an external platform.
3.13 BuyShield Service for Local Pickup:
3.13.1 Optional BuyShield Service
? Adding BuyShield to Listings:
? Sellers can select an "Add BuyShield Service" option when creating or editing a listing.
? The option is only available for eligible local pickup items and is not available for high-risk, counterfeit-prone items.
? Item Eligibility:
? The system uses AI to determine item eligibility based on category and risk factors.
? Items identified as high-risk are automatically flagged, and the BuyShield option is disabled without notifying the seller.
3.13.2 Transaction Flow
? Initiation:
? Buyer selects an item with BuyShield enabled and proceeds to purchase.
? The buyer is told that BuyShield protects the buyer from cash theft and signals to the seller you are very interested and the seller will put the item on a 72 hour hold for you.
? The system places an authorization hold on the buyer's payment method for the purchase amount, valid for 72 hours.
? Buyer can opt out of using BuyShield if they prefer another payment method.
? If the buyer has not supplied payment information in the past, it will store it on stripe.  All financial information is stored on stripe because they are PCI compliant. 
? Future transactions from the buyer will utilize stripe to facilitate the financial transaction.
? If the transaction fails, EchoList will ask for new financial information and use stripe to store that information.
? Meeting and Pickup:
? Buyer and seller arrange to meet for local pickup.
? Upon meeting, only the seller may adjust the transaction amount if agreed upon.
? Adjustment of Amount:
? Seller Adjusts Amount:
? Seller inputs the new amount into the system.
? Buyer receives a push notification and in-app message with the adjusted amount.
? If increasing the amount, the system attempts to authorize the difference after buyer approval.
? Buyer Approval Process:
? If the buyer approves, and the amount is higher than initially agreed upon the authorization hold is updated.
? If the buyer rejects, the original amount remains on hold or the transaction can be canceled.
? If the transaction is canceled the amount on hold is released and the funds are returned to the buyer.
? As soon as the buyer cancels the transaction, the seller is notified.
? As soon as the buyer confirms the transaction, the seller is notified.
? Confirmation and Completion:
? Proof of Transaction:
? Seller must capture a valid photo of the buyer with the item using the app.
? The system checks to see if the photo is valid. A valid photo is simply a photo that is not massively blurry or all one color. The AI algorithm is used to detect the presence of both a person (buyer) and the item in the photo. The AI will check for this, and if it does not pass, it will ask the seller to take another picture. The AI will ask for a new picture up to 2 times, after that the picture is accepted.
? Buyer Confirmation:
? Buyer confirms the transaction completion in the app before leaving.
? Funds are captured from the buyer's payment method.
? If the buyer leaves without confirming the transaction, the seller needs to dispute the transaction with EchoList and utilize the photo they captured as proof the buyer received the item listed.
? Fund Release:
? EchoList deducts BuyShield service fees from the transaction amount.
? Remaining funds are released to the seller's designated payment method promptly.
? Transaction Timeout:
? If the transaction is not completed within 72 hours:
? The authorization hold is automatically canceled.
? Funds are released back to the buyer.
? Both parties are notified of the cancellation.
? When the transaction starts it lets both the buyer and seller know this transaction needs to occur within 72 hours.
3.13.3 Exclusion of High-Risk Items
? AI-Based Item Screening:
? The system automatically identifies items prone to counterfeiting (e.g., high-end electronics, designer goods).
? BuyShield option is disabled for flagged items without notifying the seller to prevent confusion.
? Seller Guidance:
? Sellers are not given the option to select BuyShield for ineligible items.
? Guidelines on acceptable items for BuyShield are available in the help section.
